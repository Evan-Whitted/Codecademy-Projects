# Codecademy-Projects

Each folder is a different project that I completed in my Codecademy courses. 
All the projects that I completed are not here, but some of my favorites are so I can go back and check on the different design elements.

If you have too much time on your hands, feel free to jump to evans_dumb_number_game.
This was the first bit of JS I ever wrote, and it definitely lives up to its name.

Later, Partner.
